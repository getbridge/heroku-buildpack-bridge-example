// Joining a Bridge channel
//
// In order to join a Bridge channel, clients must provide the name 
// of the channel to join and a handler object on which RPC calls 
// in the channel will act on. Note that the client that is joined 
// to the channel is whoever created the handler, not necessarily the 
// client executing the join command. This means clients can join other
// clients to channels by having a reference to an object of theirs.
//
// Only Bridge clients using the private API key may call the join command. 
// However, those clients may join other clients using the public API key on their behalf.
//

  log: function(msg){
